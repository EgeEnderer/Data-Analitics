Revenue Forecasting Models: ARIMA and Holt-Winters

Overview
This folder contains Python scripts that were developed to build and evaluate ARIMA and Holt-Winters time series forecasting models for revenue analytics project.
These models were used to generate both short term (three months) and long term (one year) revenue forecasts as part of a broader revenue analysis and reporting project.

Purpose
The forecasting models provide reliable estimates of future total revenue to support leadership and market managers in making informed decisions about operations and strategy.
The models help identify trends and seasonal patterns in historical daily revenue data.

Data
The models were built using one year of daily ARPU and total revenue data for seven markets. The raw dataset contained missing elements, which were handled by applying data cleaning and imputation techniques in Python before modeling.

Contents
The Python code includes:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Scripts to read the raw data, handle missing values, and prepare the time series.

ARIMA Model:
Code to identify optimal parameters, fit the ARIMA model, validate results, and generate forecasts.

Holt-Winters Model:
Code to apply exponential smoothing, capture seasonal effects, validate the model, and produce forecasts.

Visualization:
Scripts to plot actual vs. forecasted values for clear comparison.

Tools and Libraries
Python 3

Pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical operations

Statsmodels for ARIMA and Holt-Winters implementations

Matplotlib  for data visualization

Usage
The scripts can be run in sequence or adapted for other time series forecasting tasks. Parameters and model configurations can be adjusted to fit new data or different forecasting horizons
