## Revenue Analytics Project

### Overview

  This project started for a leadership team that needs transparent insight into the drivers of company wide revenue. They want ongoing visibility of revenue processes and reliable forecasting to improve business outcomes. 
  The project delivers sales reports and forecasts for total revenue in both short term and long term, and identifies key market segments contributing to results. This work uses advanced analytics to support strategic planning and revenue growth.

### Data and Preparation

  One year of daily data is analyzed, including ARPU by market (Markets 1–7) and total revenue in EUR. The raw data had missing entries, so Python is used to impute missing values and preserve continuity.
  Ensuring complete, high quality data is vital for accurate analysis and forecasting. Data quality checks were performed to confirm the dataset is suitable for reporting and modeling.

### Power BI Reporting

  Using Microsoft Power BI,interactive dashboards are built to describe the current business situation. The reports visualize key metrics (ARPU trends by market and total revenue over time) and highlight any data issues or trends.
  The dashboards provide executives and managers with an intuitive, data driven view of performance.

### Revenue Forecasting

  To project future revenue, we applied proven time series models. We used an ARIMA model and a Holt-Winters exponential smoothing model, both widely used for forecasting time series data
  
  These models capture trends and seasonal patterns in the data. Forecasts were produced for the next three months and the next year, giving both short term and long term outlooks. The forecasts are included in a dedicated section of the Power BI report for easy monitoring.
Market Contributions
  We identified which market segments drive total revenue most significantly. Analysis of each market’s ARPU and subscriber base shows which regions contribute the largest share of revenue. For example, hypothetical Markets X and Y have consistently higher ARPU and account for a disproportionate share of GATWOOD’s earnings. Highlighting these top performing markets guides management focus and resource allocation.

### Strategic Factors

  In addition to quantitative analysis, we considered other factors that can influence revenue. For instance, average revenue per user (ARPU) has been under pressure from competitive pricing and inflation.
  Customer churn, data usage trends, marketing campaigns, regulatory changes and macroeconomic shifts can all cause revenue to fluctuate. The summary slides will note that these internal and external factors should be considered when designing optimal growth strategies for leadership team. 
  
### Key Deliverables:
  
  A Power BI report on current performance, with data validation and quality checks.
  Short-term (3-month) and long-term (12-month) total revenue forecasts using ARIMA and Holt-Winters models.
  Analysis of top markets contributing to revenue, guiding strategic focus.
  Executive slides summarizing findings and recommending attention to factors like ARPU trends, churn, and market dynamics.
 
  Skills Highlighted: This analysis involved data cleaning and imputation using Python, development of time-series forecasting models (ARIMA and Holt-Winters), and creation of interactive dashboards in Power BI.   
  These deliverables give leadership team the actionable insights needed for data-driven strategy and revenue growth.
